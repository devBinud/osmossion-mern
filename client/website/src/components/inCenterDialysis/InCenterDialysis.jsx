                <h5>1. Introduction</h5>
                <p>
                Kidney failure, also known as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), is a serious condition that can be caused by various factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney stones, and more. When the kidneys cease to function, the body becomes incapable of eliminating waste and excess fluids, leading to a dangerous accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream. In the early stages of CKD, it is possible to slow down or even halt the progression of the disease through lifestyle changes and medication. However, when the disease advances to its final stage, known as CKD 5 or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), dialysis or kidney transplantation becomes necessary to sustain life.

                    2. Understanding Kidney Failure and Hemodialysis
                </h5>
                <p>
                After consulting with your nephrologist, you may determine that in-center hemodialysis is the ideal choice for your lifestyle and specific needs. In-center hemodialysis is a therapy that effectively replaces the vital functions of a patient's kidneys by purifying the blood from waste and excess fluids. It involves the utilization of a hemodialysis machine and a specialized filter known as a dialyzer, or artificial kidney, which effectively eliminates toxins from the blood. Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood flows through plastic tubing to the dialyzer, where it undergoes thorough cleansing before being safely returned to the body.
